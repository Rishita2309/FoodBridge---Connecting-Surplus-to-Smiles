                <b>Bridging Surplus Food to Those Who Need It Most</b>
                <p>At FoodBridge, we believe that no food should go to waste while millions struggle
                    with hunger. Our mission is to create a seamless, technology-driven platform that
                    connects restaurants, households, and food businesses with NGOs, shelters, and
                    charities. Every year, tons of edible food are discarded due to excess production
                    or unsold inventory. We aim to turn this waste into nourishment by enabling quick
                    and easy redistribution of surplus food to those who need it most.</p>

                <b>Bridging the Gap Between Surplus and Need</b> <br/>
                At FoodBridge, we strive to create a world where surplus food is never wasted but
                 instead reaches those who need it the most. Through our platform, we make food
                  donation simple, efficient, and impactful—connecting donors with NGOs and 
                  shelters seamlessly.
                <br /><br/>
                <b>Why It Matters</b><br />
                Hunger and food waste are two sides of the same coin. 
                While millions struggle to find their next meal, vast amounts of food go to 
                waste daily. FoodBridge is committed to changing this by enabling businesses, 
                restaurants, and households to share surplus food with organizations that serve
                 the underprivileged.
                <br /><br/>
                <b>How We Make a Difference</b><br />
                With just a few clicks, donors can list surplus food, and verified NGOs or 
                volunteers can claim it. Our platform ensures safe and efficient food 
                distribution, reducing waste while feeding communities. The impact dashboard
                 lets donors track their contributions, making every meal count.
